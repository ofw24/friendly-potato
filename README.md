This is our final report for EN.553.432 Bayesian Statistics.

A statistical algorithm for predicting the gain in life expectancy within a country is created using a double logistic random walk model with variable drift. This model builds off of deterministic methods used in practice often, with the incorporation of a hierarchical Bayesian framework for allowing greater flexibility in choice of model parameters and estimation.

This project was strongly informed by the work done by Raftery, et al. A full list of citations can be found at the end of the report within this repository.
